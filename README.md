##Red Shift Tennessee

#Motivation

I am interested in politics and voting trends. Nashville and Chattanooga are growing in population. An obvious hypothesis is that this would act as a blue buffer against the red areas of the state. However, that has not proven to be the case as TN further entrenches itself as a red state. 
Data Question

As Tennessee has become a solidly Republican-voting state, what have been the voting trends in the four largest cities (Memphis, Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville) over the past 20 years? Is there any correlation among them with each other and the state as a whole? Can we infer future movement in either party direction from this data as the population increases and the demographics change?
